### Session 3: Building Your First Demo Project

Time to hop on a team again. Find a company you like. Imagine you are their developer relations engineer, and go to their docs portal. Do some brainstorming with your team and develop a demo project for one of the product’s features. Think about a project that solves a real-world problem and inspires devs to use your company’s products.

Once you choose your project, write the project specification and its system diagram. Put this information together in a slide deck. Share it on social media (tip: you can transform a presentation into pictures and share them on Twitter). 

* Bonus challenge: actually implement your demo and showcase your code!
