### Assignment 2: Developer Relations and Content Creation

Best DevRel work usually gets accomplished on teams. We will do the same for this assignment. 

Find a company you like. Find out if the company has a dev rel team and, if possible, try to reach out to their dev rel team.
Discover one / or more of their best practices for dev rel and write a blog post about those best practices (it can also be a success story, but again, focused on something that is related to developer relations). If the company does not have a dev rel team, or you cannot get access to the team, perform the research in your team and do an “audit” for the best practices that the company uses (feel free to inspect their docs, social media, Discord, website, developer tooling, community, etc).
 
Do some research on best practices for content creation on the platform where you choose to publish your article. Even 10 minutes of Google search are worth it, if you do not have much time. Feel free to publish the article where you want: it can be your personal website, it can be Medium, Mirror, etc.

Publish the article, and try to advertise it as well as you can (eg: get the attention of the team you wrote about; run a campaign on Twitter that you have a challenge from DevRel Uni to write an article and try to get people to help you promote it, etc.). Be CREATIVE!
Create some slides where you attach:

  - a link to your article (you can additionally share if you want your article on Twitter and LinkedIn).
  - get some understanding about the attention and feedback the article got (eg: likes on LinkedIn / Twitter; no. of views from the platform where you published the article; the feedback you received; who did your content help, etc.) and write them down
  - explain briefly some of the strategies that you used to promote the article
  - mention what went well and what you would do differently (in terms of writing the article and promoting it)
