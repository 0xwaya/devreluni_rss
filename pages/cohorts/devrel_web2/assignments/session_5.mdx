### Session 5: Events: Meetups, Hackathons, and Conferences

What better way to learn about events than actually getting involved in one! This assignment is a group task. You’re required to organize an event with your assigned team. It can be as simple as a Twitter space.

When you first start running any kind of event, you might not have many people attending. Don't let this discourage you – it's part of the process.

If you're stuck for inspiration for the theme of the event, consider lightning talks. Select any topic that piques your curiosity. It could be about Developer Relations (DevRel), Artificial Intelligence (AI), tidal flats, your favourite tech, DIY tips – anything you find intriguing! Then, prepare to deliver a captivating 5-minute presentation on that topic. Be ready to answer any queries the audience might have after your presentation!

Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1:** Select the date of the event and the roles. You'll need at least one moderator, while the rest of the team can join as speakers. Since organizing an event requires some promotion and time, we'd be planning and promoting this week and running the actual events next week.

**Step 2:** Plan the promotion of the event. At the very least, you will need some visuals to share on social media (like Twitter or LinkedIn) and an interesting description.

**Step 3:** Promote, promote, promote!

**Step 4:** Prepare your presentation and communicate your topic to the moderator in advance. If you're a moderator, research best practices for moderation. Make sure you have the running order of the guests, maybe an interesting fact about them when you introduce them. Conclude the talks with a summary and be ready to handle questions from the audience.

2. To submit this assignment, submit the presentation you created for the event if you are a speaker. If you are a moderator, mention that you were a moderator and summarize the event.

Don't forget to promote your event on  LinkedIn, Twitter, and our Discord.
