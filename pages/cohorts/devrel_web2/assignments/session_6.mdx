### Session 6: Building DevRel Strategy - Now, What Do You Do?

**You have achieved a lot so far!**

This last assignment is different. Instead of focusing only on the last session, this assignment is meant to help you crystallize your learnings during your entire DevRel University journey so far.

Write a post (small article) where you describe your main learnings during the program and what you have achieved so far. Whenever you want to remember a particular piece of information, you will be able to reread this piece of content. Feel free to share it on Twitter, LinkedIn, and our Discord.
