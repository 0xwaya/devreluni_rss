### Session 4: How to land your first DevRel role

 This assignment is an individual assignment. There is a very competitive market right now, so when applying for a job, you need to differentiate yourself. Starting with the collective notes from the Mirro board, and adding some research that you conduct yourself (you can interview people, and you can find stories and advice online about how people got jobs), create a high-quality presentation about finding a job. Imagine you were to teach the content from the presentation to a group of people, so feel free to be as creative as you wish with your format.

 Share your presentation on LinkedIn and Twitter.
