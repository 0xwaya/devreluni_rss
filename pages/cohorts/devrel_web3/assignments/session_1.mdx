### Assignment 1


1.- **Select a protocol you like and imagine you are their Developer Advocate. You are asked to do their Q3 strategy.**

Keep in mind; 

- Given the bear market, the protocol wants to save as much money as possible
- There is a product launch mid June 
- Identify if the protocol you selected is Developer Plus or Developer First and plan accordingly
- Think about the strategy in terms of  content, events, gathering feedback, developer branding, etc.


2.- **Write a Twitter thread about your 30-60-90 day strategy as a Developer Advocate and share it on Twitter.**

      - You can link your twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/DevrelUni/status/1647937353019805702?s=20)
 
      - If you create it for a specific company, you can tag the company. Alternatively, you can do a general   plan not focused on a particular company.
