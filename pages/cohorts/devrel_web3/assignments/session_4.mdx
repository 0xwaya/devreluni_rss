### Assignment 4

1. This one is a collaborative assignment. Find someone you want to work with (feel free to use Discord to facilitate creating pairs).
In groups of 2-3, decide on a web3 protocol you like (it can also be a web2 company if your focus is web2). Imagine you are their developer advocates and were tasked to write an article about one of their products or an overview about the protocol/ company itself. 

2. Do some research on best practices for content creation on the platform where you choose to publish your article. Even 10 minutes of Google search are worth it, if you do not have much time. Feel free to publish the article where you want: personal website /Medium /Mirror /Hashnode, etc. 

3. Publish the article, and try to advertise it as well as you can (eg: get the attention of the team you wrote about; run a campaign on Twitter that you have a challenge from DevRel Uni to write an article and try to get people to help you promote it, etc.). Be CREATIVE!

4. Create some slides where you attach:
    * a link to your article
    * get some understanding about the attention and feedback the article got (eg: likes on LinkedIn / Twitter; no. of views from the platform where you published the article; feedback you received; who did your content help, etc.) and write them down
    * explain briefly some of the strategies that you used to promote the article
    * mention what went well, and what you would do differently (in terms of writing the article and promoting it)
