### Assignment 2 - Documentation

1. **Find a web3 protocol you like. Imagine you are their developer advocate and make an improvement to their documentation.**
 
  Here are some potential ideas: 
  
  - create a small how-to guide/ a tutorial/ a documentation strategy document/ identify optimal learning journeys, etc.
  - create a small piece of content (eg: a blog post, a video, a podcast, etc.) that you think would be useful for the community


2. **Create some slides where you attach the link to the piece of content that you created and your thoughts on how it improves the documentation**

 (eg: I really liked product X from company/ protocol Y. However, I could not find a tutorial on how to use feature Z, so I decided to create one myself).
